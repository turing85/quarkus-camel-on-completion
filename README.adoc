This project shows how we can poll a source database periodically, transfer the data read to a target database and then mark the data in the source database as processed.

== Prerequisites
To run this project, docker or a docker-compatible container environment is used.

For the initial startup, an internet connection is necessary to pull the necessary images (postgresql and MS SQL).

== Overview
The application is driven by a scheduler, which fires every ten seconds.
The scheduler is configured as greedy, so if data is read, it will fire again immediately.
Furthermore, the scheduler is fired to run synchronously, i.e. it wil. not fire if it is already running.

When the scheduler fires, at most two entries from the database will be fetched from the source database.
If any entries were fetched, the entries will be transferred to the target database.
Finally, the entries fetched from the source database will be marked as processed.

== Running the example
To run the example, we can execute

[tabs]
====
Linux::
+
.Run the application
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean quarkus:dev
----

Windows::
+
.Run the application
[source,cmd]
----
mvnw.cmd clean quarkus:dev
----
====

This will initialize and start the source- (postgres) and target- (ms sql) database.
The source database will be filled with three entries, which will be transferred to the target database.
